# FullStack-SMS-Spam-Classifier
This application is built using Flask for the backend and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend. The backend uses a Machine Learning model trained on a dataset of SMS to classify incoming messages as either ‘spam’ or ‘not spam’. The frontend provides user-friendly interface where users can input their messages and receive instant predictions.
